<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Awesome depiction of the DC superhero and a legendary potrayal of The Joker</p>

<h3>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</h3>
<p>One of the best sc-fi movies of all time and seems to be becoming more and more relevant with the boom of AI technologies.</p>

<h3>Lord of The Rings</h3>
<p>Amazing story telling and unbelievable effects across both the trilogies.</p>
